# Badgerd SDWireC
[SDWireC](https://badgerd.nl/sdwirec) is a yet another implementation of SDWire of Tizen. In our design we used USB-C interface to interact with the host device or in other words Test Server(TS).

In **sdwirec-hw** folder, you can find the KiCAD project files of SDWireC, hardware design mostly based on Tizen but we changed some of the components since they are out of stock today.

In **sdwirec-sw** folder, you will find the clone of https://git.tizen.org/cgit/tools/testlab/sd-mux which has the software that you need to interact with SDWireC.

## Please follow the instructions in [Quick Start Guide](https://badgerd.nl/sdwirec/#quick-start) to give SDWireC a kickstart!
